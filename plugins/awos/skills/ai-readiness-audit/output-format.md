# Audit Report Format

Use this template when presenting audit results. Replace placeholders with actual values.

### Per-Dimension Artifact Format

Each dimension artifact is a **JSON file** (`{name}.json`). The `audit-core` engine pass writes it; `node dist/cli.js render <audit.json> --format md` and `node dist/cli.js render <audit.json> --format html` render the aggregated audit JSON to `report.md` / `report.html` respectively. The engine never writes Markdown or HTML — JSON is the source of truth.

Top-level schema:

```json
{
  "dimension": "<dimension name slug>",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "score": <number>,
  "coverage": <number between 0.0 and 1.0>,
  "checks": [<per-check records — see below>]
}
```

Field notes:

- **`score`** — Σ awarded category weights (uncapped, additive).
- **`coverage`** — `score ÷ Σ weights of applicable categories` (categories whose `applies_when` evaluated to false are excluded from both numerator and denominator).
- **`checks`** — one record per check block in the dimension file. Nothing is dropped; this JSON is the source of truth.

Per-check record schema (all fields required unless explicitly marked optional):

```json
{
  "check_id": "CODE-NN",
  "code": [<numeric category code(s)>],
  "method": "detected|computed|judgment",
  "status": "PASS|WARN|FAIL|SKIP",
  "value": "<string | number | null>",
  "evidence": ["<one evidence item per string>"],
  "weight_awarded": <number>,
  "weight_max": <number>,
  "applies": true|false,
  "reliability": {
    "tag": "maximal|minimal|not-reliable",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    "note": "<source description or 'bounded-by-rubric' for judgment>"
  },
  "source": "<source name from standards.toml>",
  "definition": "<category definition from standards.toml>",
  "hint": "<definition> · <value-derivation> · <reliability tag (confidence)> · <source (year)> · <method>",
  "plain": "<one-sentence non-technical explanation of what this check verifies>"
}
```

Field notes:

- **`check_id`** — taken verbatim from the dimension check heading id: the `XXX-NN` token from the `### XXX-NN:` heading (e.g. `SEC-02`, `ARCH-06`, `SDD-04`).
- **`code`** — array of numeric category codes from the check's `**Category:**` line (resolved against `standards.toml`).
- **`method`** — read from `standards.toml` for the category code. One of `computed`, `detected`, or `judgment`.
- **`status`** — for `computed`/`detected` checks this comes verbatim from the detector output (`node dist/cli.js detect <code> <repoPath>`); for `judgment` checks it is the auditor's evaluation of the category's `rubric` against its `evidence_required` items.
- **`value`** — `string | number | null`. Detectors may return a numeric value (e.g. file sizes, counts, ratios); judgment checks return a string conclusion. Use `null` only if the value is genuinely unavailable.
- **`evidence`** — array of evidence strings (file paths, counts, snippets). For computed/detected, taken verbatim from the detector output.
- **`weight_awarded`** — equals `weight_max` on PASS; 0 otherwise (WARN, FAIL, SKIP).
- **`weight_max`** — the `weight` for this category in `standards.toml`, always — even when the check is SKIP (`applies: false`). `applies: false` is the sole signal to exclude a category from the coverage denominator; `weight_max` is never 0 solely because of SKIP.
- **`applies`** — `true` unless the category's `applies_when` expression evaluated to false for this project.
- **`reliability.tag`** — starts at the category's `reliability_default` (`maximal`, `minimal`, or `not-reliable`). For judgment checks, the note must include `bounded-by-rubric`.
- **`reliability.confidence`** — `"high"` for `computed`/`detected` checks (detector output is deterministic); `"medium"` for `judgment` checks (bounded by rubric quality).
- **`source`** / **`definition`** — copied verbatim from the matching `[category.*]` table in `standards.toml`.
- **`hint`** — five-part human-readable summary; shown as small print inside the HTML tooltip (the specialist detail).
- **`plain`** — one plain-language sentence a non-technical stakeholder understands ("Blocks AI agents from opening secret files like `.env` before they run a command."). The HTML tooltip leads with this, demoting `hint` to small print below it. Optional but recommended on every check; when absent the renderer falls back to `definition`.

Any dimension-specific summary data consumed by downstream dimensions (e.g. the topology output used by later dimensions via `depends-on`) must be included as an additional top-level key in the JSON object alongside `dimension`, `date`, `score`, `coverage`, and `checks`.

### Report blocks (authored into `audit.json`)

The renderer is deterministic and contains no LLM. The plain-language narrative a CEO reads is authored by the **orchestrator** (SKILL.md Step 6.4) and stored as three optional top-level keys in `audit.json` (and `org-portfolio.json`). All are optional — the renderer degrades to the capability headline + a mechanical FAIL/WARN recommendation list when they are absent.

```json
{
  "headline": {
    "delivery": [
      {
        "label": "Merges / active contributor",
        "display_value": "3.2 / contributor"
      },
      {
        "label": "Deployment frequency",
        "display_value": "1.9 / wk",
        "band": "High",
        "check_id": "ADP-09"
      },
      {
        "label": "Cycle time (Jira In-Progress→Done)",
        "gated": "tracker"
      }
    ],
    "scale": [
      {
        "label": "Source size",
        "display_value": "30,058 LOC · Python",
        "check_id": "ADP-G11"
      }
    ],
    "reach": {
      "ai_tooling": "AI agent config present (partial)",
      "contributors": "4 active contributors (90d)"
    }
  },
  "insights": [
    {
      "theme": "Secrets & supply-chain hygiene",
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "weak_areas": ["Security", "Supply Chain Security"],
      "so_what": "Plain 'what this means' for a non-technical reader.",
      "improves": "Plain 'what gets better if fixed'."
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "priority": "P0|P1|P2",
      "title": "Plain-language fix title",
      "dimension": "Security",
      "check_id": "SEC-02",
      "effort": "Low|Medium|High",
      "detail": "Plain-language paragraph: what to do and why."
    }
  ]
}
```

Authoring integrity: `headline` numbers and `recommendations` are **transcribed verbatim** from real checks (cite the `check_id`); DORA `band` values are read from the check's `hint` ("DORA-banded (high)"). Git-only display values (merges per contributor, LOC per contributor) are read from `collected/git.json` → `raw.window_stats` and carry no `band` or `check_id`. Gated rows (`gated: "tracker"` for cycle time, `gated: "incident"` for MTTR) omit `display_value` when no connector is reachable, causing the renderer to print the appropriate "needs … connector" placeholder. The orchestrator never invents numbers — it selects and phrases. `recommendations[]` here and the long-form `recommendations.md` come from one authoring pass and must stay in sync.

## Report Template

Write the full report to `context/audits/YYYY-MM-DD/report.md` and also display it to the user.

```markdown
# Code Audit Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope:** [all dimensions | single dimension name]
**Audit Total:** N pts
**Coverage Ratio:** XX% rel. today's standard
**Previous Audit:** [YYYY-MM-DD — N pts, XX% | none]

## Summary

| #   | Dimension | Points | Coverage | Delta | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
| --- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ | --- |
| 1   | Name      | N      | XX%      | +/-N  | 0        | 0    | 0      | 0   |
| …   | …         | …      | …        | …     | …        | …    | …      | …   |

## Dimension: [Name]

**Score:** N pts (coverage XX% rel. today's standard)
**Reliability:** {tag} ({confidence}) — {note}

| #   | Check                   | Category | Weight | Status | Reliability                 | Evidence       |
| --- | ----------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | What the check verifies | 3        | 4      | PASS   | maximal (high) — git native | one-line proof |
| 2   | What the check verifies | 1        | 6      | FAIL   | minimal (low) — proxy \*    | what's missing |
| 3   | What the check verifies | 2        | 3      | WARN   | not-reliable — no data      | partial issue  |
| 4   | What the check verifies | none     | —      | SKIP   | —                           | not applicable |

`*` marks a lower-bound measurement (reliability tag: `minimal`).

(Repeat the dimension section for each dimension that was executed.)

## Top Recommendations
