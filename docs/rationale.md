# The `awos` Philosophy: Why It Works

In the new era of AI-powered development, it's tempting to ask an LLM to "just write the code." However, this often leads to poor results. This document explains the thinking behind the **`awos`** framework and why its structured process is the key to building high-quality software with AI agents.

## The Problem: LLMs Are Like Confused Interns

Imagine you have a new, very smart intern. If you tell them, "build a login feature," without any other information, what will you get? They will build _a_ login feature, but it probably won't be the _right_ one for your product.

LLMs are the same. They are incredibly powerful, but they start with zero knowledge of your project. Without complete, well-organized information about the problem, the desired solution, and the technical environment, an LLM will produce generic, incorrect code. **The `awos` framework is designed to turn a confused intern into an expert team member by giving it the context it needs.**

## Your New Job: Making Your Product the Next "Tetris"

LLM agents are brilliant at creating things they already understand deeply. Ask one to make a game like Tetris, and it will do a great job. Why? Because the concept of Tetris is part of its vast, pre-existing knowledge.

However, the LLM knows nothing about _your_ business, _your_ product, or _your_ users.

The most essential work for a modern software team is to provide this context to the AI agents. Your job is to carefully explain every piece of your project until the LLM "knows" your product as well as it knows Tetris. **`awos` provides the tools to teach the AI the rules of your unique game.**

## How We Teach: The Power of Specifications

The primary "lesson plan" for teaching an LLM is a good specification.

A proper specification doesn't just list features. It clearly explains _what_ a feature must do, _why_ it is needed, and _who_ it is for. This understanding of the ultimate goal is essential. When everyone (including the AI agent) is aligned on the goal, we can build exactly what is expected on the first try.

This is the key to true efficiency. The power of LLMs is not just writing code fast; it's writing the _correct_ code fast. **A good specification ensures the AI's speed is applied in the right direction.**

## A Complete Story: The `awos` Vertical Structure

A product is more than just a collection of features; it has a broader context of business goals and technical rules. Each specification exists for a reason that is part of a bigger story.

That is why **`awos`** is built on a vertical structure, moving from a high-level vision down to the smallest implementation detail. Think of it like using a map with different zoom levels.

1. **Product Definition**: The 10,000-foot view of the entire world.

2. **Roadmap**: Zooming in on the country we will visit this year.

3. **Functional Spec**: Zooming in on the specific city we are exploring today.

4. **Technical Spec**: The detailed street map of that city.

5. **Task List**: The turn-by-turn directions for our walk.

Each step provides the right information at the right level of detail. By following this process, you tell a complete and coherent story to the AI agents, ensuring they have the full context they need to build your vision into reality.
