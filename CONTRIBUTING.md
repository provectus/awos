## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, test, and make sure everything still works
1. Format the repository with `npx prettier --write .`
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
1. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Test your changes with the Spec-Driven Development workflow to ensure compatibility.
