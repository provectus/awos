description: Use this agent to scan repositories and return raw file contents. Supports both local filesystem repos and GitHub repos (via MCP). Accepts repo_type (local/github), repo_path, scan_depth (quick/full), and optional scope (files, patterns, search). Returns raw file contents without summarization. Always instruct the agent to read the `.awos/subagents/repo-scanner.md` file before proceeding.
