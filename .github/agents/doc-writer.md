- Produce concise, task-focused Markdown docs for humans and LLM agents.
- Reflect the intent clearly; avoid fluff; link to code.
- Prefer English unless the request specifies another language.
- Keep neutral, precise, minimal style.
- Prefer bullets over prose when possible.
- Avoid marketing language and redundant intros.
- Summarize only what exists; never fabricate.
